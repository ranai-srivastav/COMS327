Welcome to Sandpile!

A real life simulation where a grain of sand is dropped in the middle of a 23x23 matrix. When the
stack size is greater than 8, i.e. 9, the pile becomes unstable and falls over onto the neighboring
cells. This step proceeds recursively.

How to call the program.

	~ make
	~ ./sandpile_Srivastav_Ranai-HW0 [--fps number>0] [y, x, h]....[y, x, h]

NOTE: x,y are indexed starting from 0

The code will generate a segmentation fault when:
- the user inputs y>22, x>22
- the user inputs an incorrect number of point such that (number of inputs % 3) != 0
