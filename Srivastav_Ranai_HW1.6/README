Welcome to Pokemon v1.6
    To run the game, cd into the folder and run these commands
        ~ make
        ~ ./game [--numtrainers]

    
	You can now move from map to map. The player initially spawns on the center map (200,200). The player can move one map at a time through the exits or fly to different maps using the f<x><y> command.
	The current map position is metioned on the bottom of the screen.
