# COMS327

This is my submissions for all assignments in COMS327: Advanced Programming Techniques. It is a class at Iowa State University that teaches you **C and C++**

The assignments as cumulative and require no additional files to run, as long as you have gcc installed and make installed. Each fodler has a README that talks about the specific flags that you need to use to run that code accurately.
