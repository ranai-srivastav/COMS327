September 9th       Started on the world using a Linked List

September 11th      Finished implementing a Linked List which represents the world.
                    Wrote code to initialize the Linked List and implement movement methods

September 13th      Finished debugging and adding to the LinkedList implementation
                    Realised the LinkedList implementation was really difficult, not only unnecessary
                    Moved over to an array of pointers implementation
                    Changed map.c to accept map_struct datatype values
                    
September 14th      Worked on matching up the exits
                    Worked on Paths
                    debugging errors with map
