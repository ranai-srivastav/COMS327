Welcome to Pokemon v1.3
    To run the game, cd into the folder and run these commands
        ~ make
        ~ ./game [--numtrainers]

    
    The game will generate multiple maps, where each map will have some character move. Currently, the (h)ikers and the (r)ivals
    move towards the Player Character. They do not take the shortest direct path, they go around any "bad" terrain and prefer paths and clearings.
